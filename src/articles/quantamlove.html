  <h2>Quantum Love</h2>
  
  <article>
    <p>My grip on the phone tightened as I allowed the silence between my mother and I to linger for 5 seconds, 30 seconds, 5 minutes and more. I strained my ears to hear any hints of anger, sadness, but no sound waves found their way from my quiet hometown in Massachusetts to me in my chaotic student office at UCLA. Even the comforting click of her hanging up the phone would have eased the tension between us. I waited more than half an hour on the line for her usually bright voice to respond.</p>

    <p>Uttering the words in a dark, curt tone, my mother whispered, “We can discuss more when you’re home for Christmas.”</p>

    <p>Diplomatic, right? Wrong. Before our silence that lasted long enough for me to finish up my quantum information problem set, I told her that I had not purchased a plane ticket to Logan airport to go home for Christmas and did not plan to.</p>

    <p>On any given day, my mom appears on my Caller ID list at least 10 times. When I’m doing my hair in the morning, I call my mom. When I walk from one class to another, I call my mom. If I am writing a computer program and it does not run as I expect, I call my best friend, my mom. But since I have started my chemistry PhD at UCLA, our communication has been falling apart. Our entanglement has begun to dissipate. Graduate courses, research, attempting to care for myself, making friends in a new city. The list of “operations” that have been acting on me and literally changing my brain circuitry continues to grow everyday. And as a nurse, mom to two high schoolers, and wife, my mother finds herself with new issues too. The beep of vital sign monitors, the flipping of pages, my little sister yelling, the clanging of dishes repeat in the background of our calls. The three hour time difference does not help. Space, time, and the processes that we go through everyday are changing how we communicate and the strength of our connection.</p>

    <p>A similar phenomenon occurs between quantum computers in a network. I speak to my mother with my phone, but quantum computers are connected with one another through quantum channels. Quantum channels allow quantum computers to transmit their current state and receive the states of the other computers in a network, just as a phone permits me to tell my mother about my day and hear her share her story. The quantum operations on each computer modify the strength of the connections, i.e. quantum entanglement between all of the computers. Just as with people, certain operations have negligible effects on the entanglement structure while others create connections so intricate that they can not be processed efficiently. And with my mom and I, my choice to spend Christmas away from home is an example of an operation that plunges our relationship into an unfamiliar domain. So what forced me to waver in my devotion to fulfill my mother’s desires? To the chagrin of my pragmatic brain but to the joy of my heart, I fell in love with someone who lives on the other side of the planet.</p>

    <p>Information scientists have defined constraints that allow us to characterize which operations can be performed while maintaining efficient connection in quantum networks. This leads to my team’s main research question: How can we explore the sequence of operations that make entanglement in our networks too complex to process? We have been using machine learning to find sequences that cause quantum networks’ entanglement to become too complex for efficient processing. I developed a machine learning agent that chooses sequences of quantum operations on quantum computers that create entanglements structures too complex to process time-effectively. Our agent identified sequences of operations that do this. The sequences reveal that conducting complex operations on one computer then entangling it with all the other computers in the network increases the connections between all the computers in the network. This may seem trivial but modeling these systems takes computational power and time. Quantum computers are so new that scientists are still trying to formally define these interactions, and we have added just a little bit to this field.</p>

    <p>As I struggled to share my holiday travel plans, I wondered who could define which words push my relationship with my mother towards separation. While I grow older and become connected to more people and the operations that I perform become more involved, I worry how it will affect the foundational bonds in my life. How can I maintain the entanglement with my mother as I deepen new love with friends and romantic partners? How can I connect my new relationships to my older, more foundational bonds? I have no idea, but I’m trying to learn. There are no journal articles to read but I've been conducting simple experiments. When my mother calls and I’m with my LA friends or my partner, I pick up and let them talk to her. It fills my heart with peace to see their eyes crease from laughing so hard. They witness the beautiful aspects of my mother that I’m fortunate to see everyday.</p>

    <p>Quantum devices do not need to attend research meetings, fall in love, or check patient vitals. However, the complexity of the processes they run has the potential to simulate the chemistry necessary to develop new medicines efficiently, a task too difficult for the world’s most powerful classical computers. The data in the models lies in the quantum channels, but for use in actual drug design, this information must be processed efficiently. The research we’ve done places limits on the operations that scientists can run efficiently while modeling on quantum computers. I don’t believe there are any machine learning agents that can help me choose what to say to maintain my relationship with my mom as I build roots outside of my home, but I’m not worried about us. We’ll be ok.</p>
