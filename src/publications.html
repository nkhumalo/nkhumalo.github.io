            Una Comprensione Computazionale della Psiche Emotiva e Ordine nelle Ballate del Decameron
          </a>
        </h3>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The present thesis, written in Italian, explores the emotional psyche and narrative order embedded within the ballads of the <em>Decameron</em>, a renowned literary masterpiece by Giovanni Boccaccio. Leveraging the advancements in stylometry and natural language processing techniques, this research aims to convince medieval Italian literature scholars to produce more scholarship on the ballads and uncover the intricate patterns of human emotions and narrative organization within them. The study begins by establishing a comprehensive corpus of ballads from the <em>Decameron</em>, utilizing digital libraries and text repositories. Subsequently, using stylometric analysis, the research examines the linguistic and stylistic features that distinguish the brigata’s ballads, focusing on elements such as vocabulary, syntax, and rhyme scheme. These analyses enable the identification of authorial patterns, shedding light on the emotional expressions and narrative techniques employed by Boccaccio. A natural language processing model was used to predict the authorship of the ballads using each of the brigata’s novelle as training data. The findings of this research contribute to a deeper understanding of the emotional and narrative purpose of the <em>Decameron's</em> ballads. Results of stylometric analysis allowed for new characterization of Panfilo’s ballad as sad and revealed how similarity in the emotional psyches of the brigata transcends gender. These novel perspectives allowed for unique literary analysis of the ballads. Accurate prediction of ballad authorship demonstrates that ballads fit into the narrative structure of the <em>Decameron</em> and restore order in each of the ten days.</p>

            Ingleton Violation Through Non-Local Magic
        </h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Entropy vectors classify states in a Hilbert space according to their bipartite entanglement structure. For a particular class of states, e.g. holographic states or stabilizer states, the entropy cone is a convex polyhedral cone defined by the entropy inequalities that must be satisfied by all states in that class. While extensive research has revealed the nested structure of entropy cones, for distinct classes of quantum states, very little is known about the dynamics of entropy vectors or about transitions between entropy cones. The Ingleton inequality is used to create a class of quantum circuits and networks with linear coding solutions. We propose a reinforcement learning approach to probe entropy vector dynamics under evolution by quantum circuits. Our technique utilizes a Markov decision process to train an agent to optimally navigate the entropy vector space, identifying and categorizing circuits which violate Ingleton's inequality. For example, circuits that preserve key entanglement features associated to a class of states can be thought of as class-preserving, and therefore will not initiate a transition between entropy cones. This learning model offers an algorithmic approach to studying entanglement dynamics, providing deeper insights into the relative structure of entropy cones and the nature of state property dynamics in quantum circuits.
