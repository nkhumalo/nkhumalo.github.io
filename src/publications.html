            Una Comprensione Computazionale della Psiche Emotiva e Ordine nelle Ballate del Decameron
          </a>
        </h3>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The present thesis, written in Italian, explores the emotional psyche and narrative order embedded within the ballads of the <em>Decameron</em>, a renowned literary masterpiece by Giovanni Boccaccio. Leveraging the advancements in stylometry and natural language processing techniques, this research aims to convince medieval Italian literature scholars to produce more scholarship on the ballads... </p>

                Navigating the Quantum Resource Landscape of Entropy Vector Space Using Machine Learning and Optimization
            </a>
        <p>
            <strong>Abstract:</strong> We present a machine learning framework to study the dynamics of entropy vectors and quantum resources, including entanglement and magic, focusing on violations of entropy inequalities. Using a reinforcement learning agent formulated as a Markov decision process, we identify quantum circuits that optimally navigate the entropy vector space to generate violations of Ingleton's inequality. We complement this approach with a classical optimization algorithm to produce arbitrary numbers of Ingleton-violating states, with tunable degrees of violation, and empirically determine the maximal attainable violation for Ingleton's inequality. Our analysis reveals characteristic patterns of quantum resources that accompany Ingleton violation. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that Ingleton-violating states occupy sharply-defined, isolated regions of the Hilbert space, and are extremely rare. Together, these results establish a unified computational toolkit for studying entropy vector dynamics, tracking quantum resource evolution, and engineering circuits with controlled information-theoretic features.
